# Versa Interview
Author: Wyatt Cheang

## Problem
There was a tale when 2 prime numbers collided and a big bang happened. Scientists found out the 2 prime numbers are 3 and 5 but they need a model to generate an array of numbers to predict when the big bang will happen again.

## Solution
Create a script to iterate through 1 to 100 and replace any number divisible by 3 with the word BIG number divisible by 5 with the word BANG. If the number is divisible by 3 and 5, replace it with BIG BANG. Generate the array and output to ‘output.json’ file.
